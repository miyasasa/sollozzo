Sollozzo is command line tool developed with GO(GoLang). Sollozzo provide you can keep version info of your projects. Also you can make base CRUD operations on these projects.
 
GETTING STARTED
We apply all operation on sample project that it get the name "ibe".

COMMANDS
Sollozzo offers two options to create a new project with add a command line parameter:

 sollozzo add ibe : This command creates a new project called ibe. It's version is 1.0.0 by default
 sollozzo add ibe 1.2.3 : In the same way this creates ibe project. In addition 1.2.3 is ibe's version. The important thing here is that version info should match with %d.%d.%d pattern. 
 
 sollozzo current ibe: Gets current version of ibe.
 
 sollozzo list       : Lists your all project with version info.
 
 sollozzo remove ibe : Removes ibe project without warning.
 
 Another feature of sollozzo is that we can update our project version with "release" command and flags as --major, --minor, --build. Optionally -M ,-m and -b can be used instead of above flags in order.
 
 sollozzo release ibe --major : 1 Increase major number in version of ibe.
 sollozzo release ibe --minor : 1 Increase minor number in version of ibe.
 sollozzo release ibe --build : 1 Increase build number in version of ibe.
 
 You can apply many flag on same command line. Also increse build number if you do not add any flag.
